# 🌸 Iris Classification with Logistic Regression & Random Forest

This project demonstrates a **classification task** using two popular machine learning models:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  

The models are trained and evaluated on the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning.  
The code also includes **data visualization, evaluation metrics, and cross-validation** for a complete workflow.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Data Loading**: Load Iris dataset from CSV or sklearn datasets.  
- **Preprocessing**: Split features (X) and labels (y).  
- **Model Training**: Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  
- **Evaluation**: Print accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
- **Visualization**: Pairplot, boxplots, heatmap for data exploration.  
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform 5-fold CV for both models.
